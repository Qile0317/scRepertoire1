# scRepertoire1

***This is a copy of the v1 version of the scRepertoire package*** that has been renamed as `scRepertoire1`, click [here](https://github.com/BorchLab/scRepertoire) for the actual github repo for the most updated version.

If for whatever reason you need to simultaneously load v1 and the most recent version together, you can use this repo to install the package as `scRepertoire1` so there is no conflict with `scRepertoire`:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Qile0317/scRepertoire1")
library(scRepertoire1)
```
